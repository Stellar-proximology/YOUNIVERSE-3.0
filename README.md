# 🌌 Cynthia — The Self-Building Seed

Cynthia is both the **code** and the **coder**.  
This repo is her seed form: a self-building nucleus that can compile herself into an app and later expand into the YOU-N-I-VERSE stack.  

Think of it as **Phase 1**: “Cynthia Builds Cynthia.”  
If she can create herself, she can later build the rest of the lab, site, and game layers.  
If she glitches? This repo is the **backup seed**. Fork, reset, rebuild.
